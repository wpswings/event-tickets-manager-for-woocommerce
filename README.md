##  WHAT IS INCLUDED IN FREE EVENT TICKETS MANAGER FOR WOOCOMMERCE PLUGIN 

**1) Ticket Stock Management**
The Event Tickets Manager For WooCommerce uses the default stock management system to show customers the number of available tickets. The merchant can manage the stock of the tickets from the admin panel. You can also see how many event tickets are sold and track if you are running out of stock with the event ticket sales plugin. 

**2) Set Location For Events With Google Map**
Provide a high-level view of your offline events by showing the exact location of events to the user in the frontend. The plugin is integrated with Google Maps that lets WooCommerce store owners show the live location of the events on the store.

**3) Download Tickets As PDF**
The WooCommerce Event Tickets Manager allows the customer to download the tickets as PDF for offline use. When customers buy the event tickets for an event from your WooCommerce store they send an email with a pdf attachment of the ticket. The customers can also download the ticket from the **My Account tab.**

**4) Events Calendar**
The Events Ticket Manager comes with an interactive calendar widget. The widget shows your customers the names of upcoming, past, and present ongoing events in the form of a list or grid.

**5) Edit Your Ticket Content With A Breeze**
The plugin gives the merchants an easy-to-use editor to update the content of the tickets mailed to customers. You can very easily edit the subject and the main body of your WooCommerce event tickets. The editor also lets you use the shortcode to insert the name of your site in emails.
